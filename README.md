# Music Visualizer

Music visualizer created for G53GRA graphics module at university. Simple 3D room with visualizations on each side of room and the ceiling, can be traversed using first person shooter controls mouse+wasd with q and e being used to move camer vertically. On Windows to use correctly, set stereo mix as the default microphone then play any song on your favorite music player. Turn up system volume if the visualizations seem to be too small. Additional controls are:

  - 1: shows or hides ball objects which react to the beats in a song.  
  - 2: turns gravity off for balls
  - 3; stops balls reacting to beat of song
  - 4: freezes ball objects
  - 5: plays LonelyBoy.mp3 (use if no stereo mix available)
